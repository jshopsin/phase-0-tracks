Real-Life Algorithm

Playing Mah-jong (matching style game)

1. Determine which tile(s) are stacked the tallest

2. Determine which tile(s) are furthest apart horizontally
   (in a row filled continuously with tiles touching left
   to right) AND have at least one open side to the left or
   right

3. Find matching tiles for the tile(s) that are stacked the
   tallest and/or are the furthest apart horizontally which
   have at least one open side on the left or right

      a. If the tiles match and are available (having at least
         one open side on the left or right), then remove the
         2 matching tiles from the board

      b. If no tile(s) are found that match these prioritized
         tile(s), then look for tile(s) that are available that
         have at least one open side (left or right only) in the
         priority of tile(s) that are either stacked the highest
         or are the furthest apart horizontally (in a row filled
         continuously with tiles touching left to right)

            - If the tiles match and are available (having at
              least one open side on the left or right), then
              remove the 2 matching tiles from the board

5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all tiles have been matched and removed
   from the board
