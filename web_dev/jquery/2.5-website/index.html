        <h2>Kitten's Adventure To a New Home</h2>
        <p>When Skye and Cloudy were first brought to their new home they were very scared. This place was new to them, so they hid in the darkest place they could find. The space under the bed was a lot like the space they knew under the dumpster, but there were these strange humans that kept putting their heads underneath to look at them. These humans carried a lot of yarn which seemed fun to play with. They gave them food and eventually Skye and Cloudy came out to eat together.</p>

    <h2>More Information on Cloudy and Skye</h2>
    <p>Cloudy and Skye were adopted from a shelter when they were only 4 months old. They have grown up so much since then, but are still inseperable! Some of the reasons their mommy and daddy love them so much are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloudy and Skye are both incredibly cuddly and loving.
        <ul>
          <li>Cloudy cuddles in bed at night.</li>
          <li>Skye is a lap cat and loves cuddling on the couch.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cloudy is a great big brother and is very protective of Skye.</li>
      <li>Skye loves her wet food. Cloudy will let her eat first before he gets some of the scraps. That's okay though because Cloudy likes the dry food more.</li>
      <li>Skye and Cloudy love to play fight. They always have each other to play with, giving their mommy and daddy hours of entertainment.</li>
      <li>Skye is helping Cloudy get over his addiction to catnip.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="cat-fancier">
    <p>Cloudy and Skye are adorable gray cats. Gray in cat lingo is Blue, which is how their breed got the name "Russian Blue." For more information on Russian Blues, visit <a href="http://cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/RussianBlue.aspx">Cat Fanciers' Association</a>.</p>
    <h2>More Information on Cat Fanciers' Associaton's Website</h2>
    <p>Cat Fanciers' Assocation's website is great to connect to Cloudy and Skye's story because it shows how their breed relates to their personality.</p>
    <p> The website is a good example of an html website because there are stylistic choices made in presenting the information that is written into the html and not neccessarily written only in CSS; some of this is shown in a header tag. Within the header block are multiple div tags with various class attributes, such as:</p>
    <div id="nested-list">
      <ul>
        <li>SkinWidth - this probably determines the width of the main content in the header</li>
        <li>Row - this probably determines the width of the full header with border around the SkinWidth element.</li>
        <li>dnn-logo - this probably creates a block that links to the logo used in the header.</li>
        <li>MobileBar - this probably creates the block for the menu bar dropdown.</li>
        <li>BannerPane - this probably creates the block that the image banner is linked into.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>There are also a lot of script tags used to add JavaScript code into the html file.</p>
