* The reason for using a pomodoro timer is to keep myself focused for 30 minute increments with breaks to allow the information I am learning to have time to steep in my brain without overloading myself. This will also help to keep me from going down the rabbit hole and accidently spending more than 2 hours studying.
* I want to start with a short video introduction because I know that I am a visual learner. This will give me the basics before diving deeper and learning from different sources.
* I have learned a lot from Jon Duckett's books so far, so I know this will be another good resource for me.
* I would like to also find an additional resource to learn more from via google along with a helpful cheat sheet that I can call upon for reference.
* I think it will work better for me to interweave practicing topics I'm learning amidst studying, rather than studying for 1.5 hours and practicing for 30 minutes at the end. This way I can see if there are areas that I'm struggling with so I can spend time focusing on that instead of moving on to a different topic.
