    <h3>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h3>
      <p>HTML5 semantic tags are useful for text readers that help people with disabilities "view" the site. By adding semantic tags, it is adding meaning to the content so the text reader can add emphasis, breaks, etc. to how the text is read. I personally like using the strong tag to add bold or a strong voice. I can also see a lot of use in the article tag to create sections of content with their own headers.</p>
    <h3>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h3>
      <p>The default display of elements from the html file on a page is in the order it is written, and all stacked. CSS can be used to create in-line block displays so that items can sit next to each other in a window. CSS can also change the position of elements, but this is probably not the best practice if you are able to just change the order in the html file.</p>
    <h3>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h3>
      <p>I learned about Sublime Snippets. Snippets can be really helpful to quickly call long pieces of information in a file. I could definetly see myself using this in the future.</p>
    <h3>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h3>
      <p>Sublime Snippets were definetly the most difficult part of this challenge. It was actually the only thing I really needed to look up how to do in this GPS. To improve my understanding of how to create a snippet, I plan on creating more snippets to use in the future.</p>
